This is the master repository for COS 243 project for the electronic
bulletin board.  All students should fork their code from this
repository so they can quickly merge any shared material across
students.

It is expected that this repository *must* contain the testing
infrastructure for you to pass the project requirements.  If you do
not merge from this repository, then it is impossible to tell if your
code is working properly.

Github should notify you when the repository is modified so you know
when to pull new test content.
